# Swift_Codes_Scraper
<ul>
  <li>
    This scraper will scrape whole https://www.theswiftcodes.com website and store data in .jsonl file
  </li>
  <li>
    After that you can convert it into .json file.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Why .json file rather than .json file ?</h2>
<p>
  Because, <br>
  <b>.jsonl</b> file use less memory and better than <b>.json</b> file while scraping adding large data objects.
</p>
<h5>
  You can run this on your server.
</h5>

<h5>
  I have scraped all data from mega.pk using this scraper on server. 
</h5>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>
  You didn't see any _Proxies file because it's private I didn't add that file on my repo. <br>
  I just showed my scraping skills here.
